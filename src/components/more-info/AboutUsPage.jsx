        <p>We are team of students, alumni, and engineers based in the Greater Houston Area that felt helpless with the fight against this pandemic.</p>
        <p>We realized we could put our skills to work by organizing this project and finding the right partners to do so. This project was started in April 2020.</p>
        <p>The primary mission of this project is to reduce the current tremendous shortage in PPE for healthcare workers due to the coronavirus pandemic through manufacturing and providing low-cost equipment for clinical facilities.</p>
        <p>Our manufacturing efforts are primarily supported by <strong>Lumikha 3D</strong> (<a href="http://lumikha3d.com" target="_blank">http://lumikha3d.com</a>)</p>
